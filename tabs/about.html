        <strong>baseflight / multiwii configurator</strong> was designed to "step up the game" where the <strong>configuration</strong> required for each UAV 
        was becoming rather <span style="color: red;">complex</span> and difficult to do in certain environments as linux and mac os is getting a bigger userbase,
        i think a proper cross-platform GUI was needed to allow new users (<strong>beginners</strong>) to join the platform much <span style="color: green;">easier</span>.<br />
    </p>

        If you <strong>like</strong> this software and think it should be developer further, please consider a small <strong>donation</strong><br />
        As i am <span style="color: red">unemployed</span>, i could really use the money.<br />
        <br />
        Thank you<br />

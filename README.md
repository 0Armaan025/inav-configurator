baseflight / multiwii configurator
==================================
This project was designed to work primarily with baseflight (but should work just fine with anything using the standard MSP)

Configurator is based on chrome.serial API (currently found only in google chrome and chromium web browsers)

I am using Flotr2 as a plotting library (with a few UI tweaks).

Using "webkit" as application wrapper assures full compatibility across operating systems (Windows / Linux/ Mac OS).

Installation
------------
1. - Visit https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/baseflight-multiwii-confi/mppkgnedeapfejgfimkdoninnofofigk
2. - Click add to Chrome
3. - You are done

Alternative way

1. - Clone the repo to any local directory or download it as zip
2. - Start chromium or google chrome and go to tools -> extension
3. - Check the "Developer mode" checkbox
4. - Click on load unpacked extension and point it to the baseflight configurator directory (for example D:/baseflight-configurator)
5. - Note: Don't go "inside" configurators directory (just point to the folder)
6. - You are done

How to use
-----------
You can find the baseflight configurator icon in your application tab "Apps"
